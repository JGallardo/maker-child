# Maker Child theme

 * By Juan Gallardo
 * used on art blog at combat.io 

## Customizing 
 * Footer - replace line 22 of footer.php with your own text.
 * Primary color - Search for #f45844 which is the default color used for buttons and links. The color is commented out. I added a shade of green #47864C, just replace with whatever color you want.
 * Site title font - Replace line 20 of style.css and import the font into your project. 
 * If you are making your own child theme, please replace the screenshot.png

 I don't care what you do with my customizations, but know there might be restrictions from WordPress and from the parent theme creator of the "Maker" theme
